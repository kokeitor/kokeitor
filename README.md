- 🌱 I’m currently developing RAG systems, transformer-base text clasification architectures using agents based on large language models (LLMs).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving machine learning, data science, and generative AI.
- 🚀 In this repository, I will be developing end-to-end projects based on RAG, machine learning, multilabel clasification texts problems and LLM fine-tuning. [lot of PYTHON here] :)
